---

## 8. NEXT STEPS

**Before proceeding, we need to:**

1. **Review Setup Images** - Open and catalog the 8 image files to understand:

   - What donation levels are shown
   - What specific amounts are listed
   - What benefits each level provides
   - Which logos/branding to use

2. **Confirm Layout Preferences** - Decide:

   - Should "Post Officers" be a separate section or integrated?
   - Should volunteers be on main page or separate page?
   - Should payment processing details be prominent or in footer?

3. **Prioritize Changes** - Which phase should we tackle first?
   - Quick wins (contact info updates)?
   - High-impact (donation section overhaul)?
   - Foundation work (review all assets first)?

---

## Questions for You:

1. Should we review the setup folder images first to understand the donation levels before making changes?
2. Do you want all information on one page, or should some sections (like payment processing details) be on separate pages?
3. Are there any existing sections that should be removed or heavily modified?
4. What's the most urgent update - the contact information, donation section, or volunteer section?
5. Do you have the actual payment integration credentials from Elavon/Converge, or should we create placeholder buttons for now?

**Let me know which phase you'd like to start with, or if you'd like me to first review the setup images to understand the complete picture!**
